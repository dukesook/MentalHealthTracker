    <h2>What is PTSD and Treatment?</h2>
    <p>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition triggered by a terrifying event — either by experiencing it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety, and uncontrollable thoughts about the event.</p>

    <p>Types of PTSD include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Normal Stress Response – Happens before PTSD develops, with temporary symptoms.</li>
      <li>Acute Stress Disorder – Lasts less than a month after a trauma.</li>
      <li>Uncomplicated PTSD – Related to a single event with consistent symptoms.</li>
      <li>Complex PTSD – Caused by repeated trauma, especially in early life.</li>
      <li>Comorbid PTSD – Occurs with other mental health issues like depression or substance abuse.</li>
    </ul>
